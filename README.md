### About These Images
These faces are “ambigrams”: images that are legible both upside-down and right-side up. Created with a machine learning system, they may be displayed in any orientation.



Some of the best known works of this kind are the “[Upside-down Pictures](https://ukiyo-e.org/image/mfa/sc168251)” (Dôke jôgemi no zu, c. 1861) by Edo illustrator Utagawa Yoshitora (active 1836–1887), and a series of “[Reversible Faces](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rex_Whistler_-_Reversible_Face_-_Mayor_%26_Judge_1930.jpg)” published posthumously by the British artist, Reginald John “Rex” Whistler (1905–1944). Interested readers are referred to additional examples in George Tscherny’s 2004 book, “[Changing Faces](https://www.amazon.com/Changing-Faces-George-Tscherny/dp/B000W7M2ZW)”, and Al Seckel’s 2006 book “[SuperVisions: Topsy-Turvy Optical Illusions](https://www.amazon.com/SuperVisions-Topsy-Turvy-Illusions-Al-Seckel/dp/1402718322)”.

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, bivalent face illusions were often used to depict uncomplicated moral dualities, such as good-evil or blessed-damned. The faces in this deck reflect the ambiguities of a darker and more uncertain time, marked by ecological crisis, misinformation, identitarianism, and the social unrest of a polity divided against itself.

The images in this project were synthesized with the [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2) generative adversarial network, using pre-trained weights from the [Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset) (FFHQ), and enhanced using the [waifu2x](https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x) super-resolution library. The machine's hallucinations were alchemically influenced by the faces of individuals in [NIST Special Database 18](https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-18), to whom we acknowledge our debt. No identification with actual persons is intended or should be inferred, and any resemblance to actual persons, living or deceased, is purely coincidental.

> *You are encouraged to devise your own activities with these cards. For example:*
>
> * *Sort the cards from most to least _________.*
> * *Give names to the depicted. Write the personal motto or epitaph for each half of their duality.*
> * *Select groups of nine cards, and organize them according to the Nine Alignments (chaotic neutral, lawful evil, etc.).*

### Acknowledgments

The Ambigrammatic Figures were developed by [Golan Levin](http://flong.com/archive/) and [Lingdong Huang](https://lingdong.works/) at the [Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry](https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/), Pittsburgh, during the COVID-19 pandemic of spring 2020.

This project was realized in part through support from Nvidia Corporation and the [a2p curatorial initiative](https://a2p.bitmark.com/v2/artworks) by Casey Reas et al. The reverse side of the cards was generated with [Processing](http://processing.org), an open source toolkit for the arts.
